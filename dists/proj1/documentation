Project 1
Lexical Analyzer

Overall Design
The lexical analyzer takes a program and runs through the code, 
creating tokens for every keyword and id. In this phase, if there is any token mismatches, or errors,
it will report the error and continue on parsing. No matter where the error is at on the specified line, 
the compiler will catch it regardless in the next phase, the parser.

> make 
> ./p1 {Name of the program file}
