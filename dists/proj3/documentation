Project 3
Semantics

Overall Design
The semantics check comes into play during the parsing of the tokens. As the parset parses the 
tokens, the semantic checks are spread out at certain points to make sure the program makes sense.
Some common areas this happens at is when experssions are being evaulated, variables are being
assigned and returning values are being checked with the function return type. After this point if
the file is accepted then we can move onto teh intermediate code generation in which the only errors
that can occur will be at runtime.
