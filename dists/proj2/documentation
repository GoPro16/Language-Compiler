Project 2
Parser

Overall Design
The parser will take in a list of tokens that have been analyzed and accepted by the pass 1("Lexical Analysis"). 
It will then use the C- Grammar to determine whether or not the program is syntactically correct. The parser does this
by reading the tokens and determining which grammar rule to navigate to for the next token to be parsed. If any part of
the program is not syntactically correct then the program will print REJECT. Once the parser is finished and no errors have
been reported it will print ACCEPT, meaning it is syntactically correct and it is ready for semantics checking.
